# Introduction

There are approximately a total of one hundred thousand commercial flights every day in the world, leaving airports with the responsibility of managing operations and communication. In this fast-pasted industry, it is crucial for airports to have a total control of the everyday management, ensuring the safety of the passengers and their staff and maintaining the efficiency of their operations.

This project was created to ensure the control of the daily operations of the airport. The software presented covers the needs, preferences and responsibilities of the airport representatives and the traffic controllers to guaranty the efficiency of the airport.

# Problems the software solves

In a highly busy airport, management and traffic controllers face numerous challenges in their everyday operations. This software pretends to solve numerous of those challenges, like:

- **Revenue optimization:** the software will give the total control to the airport management to provide the adequate capacity at all times.
- **Safety:** traffic controllers will be able to control the airplanes landing and taking off at the airport.
- **Security:** traffic controllers will know at all times which airplanes are currently at the airport.

# Benefits of the software

This software will ensure to the airport management the total control of operations in their airport. The airport management will be able to optimize the traffic at the airport, the system will allow them to change the capacity at any point in time providing the freedom to increase or decrease the capacity of the airport when needed.

Traffic controllers will have the information necessary of the airplanes that are at the airport at all times, allowing them to ensure the capacity of the airport is never above the preferences of the airport representatives. They will also have control over the airplanes that are landing and leaving the airport making sure the planes at the airport are the correct ones. The information provided from the software will guarantee the efficiency of the every day operation, optimizing the airport benefits.

# Risks of the software

Despite the numerous benefits that the software provides to the airport representatives, the system has some risks to take into consideration for future updates.

While the traffic controllers should have all the information of the planes that wish to enter the airport there is the possibility of false information being sent from the planes, as there is not a system in place to assure the airplane information is correct.

Another risk of the software presented is, although the airport representatives are able to control the capacity of the airport at all time, the possibility exists of having more planes at the airport than the capacity allows if this change after the planes have entered the airport.
